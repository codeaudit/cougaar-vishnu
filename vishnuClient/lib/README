Jar info

* The xerces jar is necessary for the files in the vishnu server directory.
No other jar should be necessary to run the scheduler.  It does not depend on any alp jars.

* The client plugins should only need the core and toolkit jars in addition to xerces.jar.

* WARNING : 
    Be careful to put the xerces jar ahead of the xml4j_2_0_11 jar in the classpath or 
  neither the client nor server will work properly.

* The xerces jar is a later, improved version of the xml4j_2_0_11 jar.  
  See http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j/index.html for more information.
