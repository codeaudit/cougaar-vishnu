Scheduler README

The run scripts should run in both unix and dos, although files with .bat extensions are not provided.

The names of the run scripts indicate which web server the scheduler or the expression compiler is pointing to,
so runCompilerHammett means run the expression compiler, using the Hammett web server.

If after that, there is a "onlyXXX" this means the scheduler will only handle the XXX problem.  This is specified
by the org.cougaar.lib.vishnu.server.Scheduler.problems property set in the script, and users are encouraged to alter this property
so that the schedulers do only their problems.  This property can specify a comma-separated list of problems.

The basic runScheduler script does not define the problems property, and so will do any problem submitted to the
alp-107 web server.

Note that as long as someone somewhere on the network is running a "promiscuous" Scheduler, no 
one else need run one, but if everyone is running schedulers that handle only specific problems, you will need
to start your own scheduler.  If you don't, there can be situations where you run an ALP client and it works 
one time, and then fails another, where the reason for failure is that someone else was running a 
promiscuous scheduler the first time but not the second.  For this reason, it's generally good form to make 
your own runScheduler script that does only your problem.

At this time, the default web server is alp-107.  It's outside the firewall, so it should be accessible to
everyone.
