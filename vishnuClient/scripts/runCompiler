# This script starts the Vishnu Spec Compiler
# 
# The Vishnu Spec Compiler polls the Vishnu web server looking for specs to compile.
# When it finds a request has been posted, it gets the spec that's written in the 
# spec language and compiles it into an xml format that is convenient for the web server
# to handle.  This compiled spec is then posted back to the web server.

# For values of properties 1-4, see vishnu_server.env.xml in this directory

# CLASSPATH - the compiler needs the vishnu.jar and the xerces jar in the CLASSPATH

# PROPERTIES -
#  1) host - Vishnu web server
#  2) path - path on host to php files
#  3) user - user on the web server (mysql user)
#  4) password - password on the web server (mysql password)
#
#  Debugging params (safe to ignore):
#
#  5) debugXML - show XML sent and received over URLs 
#      (scheduler will not actually process requests)
