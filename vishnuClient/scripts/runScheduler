# This script starts the Vishnu Scheduler
# 
# The Vishnu Scheduler polls the Vishnu web server looking for problems to schedule.
# When it finds a request has been posted, it gets the problem and its scheduling specs
# and produces a schedule.  This schedule is then posted back to the web server.

# For values of properties 1-4, see com.bbn.vishnu.server.env.xml in this directory

# CLASSPATH - the scheduler needs the com.bbn.vishnu.jar and the xerces jar in the CLASSPATH

# PROPERTIES -
#  1) host - Vishnu web server
#  2) path - path on host to php files
#  3) user - user on the web server (mysql user)
#  4) password - password on the web server (mysql password)
#  5) showAssignments - dump to stdout xml that shows task to resource assignments
#  6) waitInterval    - scheduler poll period
#  7) machines - (Very Important) list of machines where Vishnu clients are running.
#     The scheduler will only try to do problems coming from these machines.
#     If empty or undefined, scheduler will try to schedule all problems 
#     posted to web server.  
#
#     Can be a comma separated list,
#     e.g. -Dcom.bbn.vishnu.Scheduler.machines="pumpernickle, hammet"
#
#	  The scheduler will print which problems it's scheduling, so if you see problems 
#     that aren't yours, you may want to restrict your scheduler.
#
#  8) problems - Specific problems this scheduler is restricted to handle.  For
#  instance, if there were two problems running on machine X, and you had schedulers
#  on machines Y and Z, and you wanted to make sure the scheduler on machine Y was only
#  doing problem #1 and the scheduler on Z only do problem #2.  In this case, 
#   on Y, you'd set -Dcom.bbn.vishnu.Scheduler.problems="problem_1" and
#   on Z, you'd set -Dcom.bbn.vishnu.Scheduler.problems="problem_2"
#
#  Debugging params (safe to ignore):
#
#  9) Scheduler.debug - specific debugging of Scheduler class
#  10) TimeBlock.debug - debugging of TimeBlock
#  11) debug - general debug
#  12) debugXML - show XML sent and received over URLs 
#      (scheduler will not actually process requests)
